I’m currently a second year graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Boston in [Computational Sciences (CSci)](https://www.umb.edu/academics/csm/interdisciplinary_programs/computational_sciences_phd) program, advised by [Prof. David Degras-Valabregue](https://www.umb.edu/academics/csm/faculty_staff/david_degras-valabregue).


I love my cat - “panda”.
